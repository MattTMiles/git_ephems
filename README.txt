Each of these parfiles has been prefit for F0, F1, DM, DM1
All FD paramaters have been removed
DMEPOCH is 59000
Planetary EPH DE438
CLK TT(BIPM2019)
UNITS TCB


An additional step that's been included into these parfiles is the fitting for DM1 and DM2 if they are found to be significant.

    - Significance is judged by the value being greater than 3-sigma
    - If they are found to be significant then they are kept in, if not they're removed
